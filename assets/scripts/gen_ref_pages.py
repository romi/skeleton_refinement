"""
Code Reference Pages Generator

This script automates the generation of code reference pages (API documentation) and their corresponding
navigation structure for use with the `mkdocs-material` documentation system.

Key Features
------------
- Automatically discovers and processes Python files in the specified source directory.
- Supports recursive navigation through directories to build hierarchical documentation.
- Generates Markdown documentation stubs using the `mkdocs-material` `:::` directive.
- Handles special files such as `__init__.py` (treated as an index) and excludes unnecessary files like `__main__.py`.
- Builds a full navigation tree and writes a summary file (`SUMMARY.md`) for quick reference.

Test Usage
----------
Hereâ€™s an example of how to test this script, assuming it is located in `docs/assets/scripts`:

```bash
python docs/assets/scripts/gen_ref_pages.py
```

The generated documentation will be ready in the `docs/reference` directory.
You should get a `docs/reference/SUMMARY.md` file with the navigation structure,
and a `docs/reference/spectral_clustering.py.md` file with the documentation stub.

Notes
-----
- This script is designed to work with the `mkdocs-material` documentation system.
  It may not work as expected with other documentation systems.
- Changing the location of the script (from `docs/assets/scripts`) requires to update the `src` variable.
